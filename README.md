An exploratory data analysis of COVID data using Microsoft SQL server.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant short- and long-term effects on the global economy, public health, and the environment. Since its emergence in 2019, the pandemic has left an indelible mark on both the global economy and the daily lives of individuals.

# Data
This data was gotten from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) from February 2020 to date.

 # Objective
To provide insights through analysis, exploration and visualization of the sourced data. 


# Processing and Cleaning

- For process simplification the original .csv file was duplicated.
- The duplicate file was then parsed and split into two separate excel files
    - CovidDeaths
    - CovidVaccinations


Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio was utilized to clean and organize the datasets to ensure accuracy. Inconsistencies in data entries and missing values were resolved, and the transformed data was summarized into comprehensive tables using helpful metrics and aggregated values. The transformed datasets were converted into comprehensive summary tables that provide a clear and concise representation of the data.
## Summary of Findings

The insights drawn from the covid data indicate that:

- There were 666,889,093 verified covid-19 cases.
- The global death percentage is 1.00 percent
- There were 6,700,339 deaths in total.
- France, UK and US had the highest infected population percentage per country.
- Europe, North and South America, and Asia were the continents with the highest recorded cases overall per continent.
- The overall number of fatalities reported by continent was led by Europe, followed by North America, Asia, and South America.
